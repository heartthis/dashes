Front end for graphite

This project is a more user-friendly interface for graphite. 
It is a collection of static pages that use the graphite web-app as a backend. 

- Uses rickshaw/D3 for graphing https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw
- Uses spin.js for loading images https://fgnass.github.com/spin.js#v1.3.3
- uses FileSaver.js https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md to export csv

- Contains a few changes to the graphite web-app to get cross-site authentication to work.
